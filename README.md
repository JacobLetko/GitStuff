# GitStuff

- this is just a small project to make using git faster and easier
- you need to have git bash installed on the computer you are using
- I use windows bat files to do everything with git
- just drag the folder into project click on setup 
- Click on update everynow and then if I change anything




### TODO

- [ ] beable to "fix" merge conflicts or ask if you want to overwrite them
- [x] make sure the setup works
- [x] make sure the update works
- [ ] make a error record file
